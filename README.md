# Java_Java_Java_selected_excercises

This repository contains solutions to selected exercises from the book 'Java, Java, Java: Object-Oriented Problem Solving (3rd ed)'.

The exercises are divided accordingly to their chapter. The files with the solutions are named by the chapter number followed by their order in the Exercises subsection in their respective chapter. For some exercises I created more than one solution, so I name the variants by adding "-variantX" at the end, where X is the number of the variant.

Some solutions are very straightforward, therefore I'll not make any additional comment to that. On the other hand, some solutions are somewhat complex, then I'll make the comments I judge important to reader's understanding.

Feel free to make comments and suggestions.
