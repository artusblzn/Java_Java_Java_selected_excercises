# Java_Java_Java_selected_excercises

This repository contains solutions to selected exercises from the book 'Java, Java, Java: Object-Oriented Problem Solving (3rd ed)'.

The exercises are divided accordingly to their chapter. Inside every file there is the exercise order and its respective number in the chapter.

Some solutions are very straightforward, therefore I'll not make any additional comment to that. On the other hand, some solutions are somewhat complex, then I'll make the comments I judge important to reader's understanding.

Feel free to make comments and suggestions.
