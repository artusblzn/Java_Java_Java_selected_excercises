/**
 * EXERCISE 2.2 Now suppose the professor in the previous exercise decides to automate the
 * transaction of looking up a studentâ€™s grade and has asked you to design a program to perform this
 * task. The program should let a student type in his or her name and ID number and the program then
 * should display his or her grades for the semester, with a final average. Suppose there are five
 * quiz grades, three exams, and two programming exercise grades. Identify the objects in this
 * program and the type of messages that would be passed among them. (Hint: The grades themselves
 * are just data values, not objects.)
 */

/*
 * I decided to not just identify objects but to create part of the actual program. Every student
 * object will have its name, id and three array of grades. As it is just a chapter 2 exercise, I'll
 * not bring more complexity than it is asked for. Another modification is that will not create any
 * user interface and getters because I'm using automated tests.
